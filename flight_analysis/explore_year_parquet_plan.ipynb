        "# Parquet Year Exploration Plan\n",
        "\n",
        "## Notebook Objectives\n",
        "- Allow the user to specify a target year (default: 2009) and load the corresponding Parquet file from `~/flight_data`.\n",
        "- Validate the existence of the Parquet file and report meaningful errors if it is missing.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Loading & Setup\n",
        "- Import `pathlib`, `pandas`, and visualization libraries (`matplotlib`/`seaborn`).\n",
        "- Parameterize the year (dropdown or text input) with 2009 as the default value.\n",
        "- Load the Parquet file into a DataFrame; display the first few rows to confirm structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Basic Statistics\n",
        "- Show DataFrame shape, column list, and dtypes.\n",
        "- Generate descriptive statistics for numeric columns (`df.describe()` transposed for readability).\n",
        "- Summarize key categorical features (top categories and frequencies).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Value Distributions\n",
        "- Select representative numeric columns (e.g., `DEP_DELAY`, `ARR_DELAY`, `DISTANCE`).\n",
        "- Plot histograms or kernel density estimates for these columns, using consistent styling and handling missing values.\n",
        "- Provide optional log-scale toggle or bin controls for interactive exploration (if supported by the environment).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Missing Value Analysis\n",
        "- Compute total and percentage of missing values per column.\n",
        "- Visualize missingness with a bar chart sorted by highest proportion; consider a heatmap if feasible.\n",
        "- Highlight columns that are entirely missing or nearly complete.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Reporting & Export\n",
        "- Summarize insights in Markdown cells after plots/tables (e.g., notable delays, heavily missing fields).\n",
        "- Optionally persist summary statistics or plots to disk for reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Next Steps\n",
        "- Suggest follow-up analyses (e.g., compare multiple years, segment by carrier or route).\n",
        "- Provide guidance for extending the notebook (e.g., merging with weather data, computing performance metrics).\n",
